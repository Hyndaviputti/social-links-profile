## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a profile card with social media links.
- Experience hover effects and focus states for all interactive elements.



## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** with custom properties
- **Flexbox** for layout
- Mobile-first design
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for additional styling

### What I Learned

Through this project, I refined my skills in designing interactive components and learned to use **HSL** colors for better color palette management. Here's a code snippet showcasing a hover effect:

```css
.buttons:hover {
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    color: black;
}
```

This effect dynamically changes the button's background and text color during hover.

### Continued Development

I aim to improve:

- Creating more reusable components for future projects.
- Exploring more advanced CSS transitions and animations.
- Better accessibility compliance for interactive elements.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped with the alignment and layout of the card components.
- [MDN Web Docs: HSL Colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) - Explained the use of HSL for color adjustments.
